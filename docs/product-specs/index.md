# Product Specs Index

Catalog of product specifications defining user-facing behavior and workflows.

- `new-user-onboarding.md` -- onboarding flow for deployment operators: environment setup, service verification, plugin validation.

When adding a new product spec:
1. Create the file in `docs/product-specs/`.
2. Add an entry to this index with a one-line description.
3. Update `docs/index.md` if the spec introduces a major new capability.
