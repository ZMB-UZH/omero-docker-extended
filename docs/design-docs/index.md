# Design Docs Index

Catalog of design documents capturing architectural decisions and operating principles.

- `core-beliefs.md` -- agent-first and repository-legibility operating principles. Defines the foundational rules for knowledge management, configuration, versioning, and documentation structure.

When adding a new design document:
1. Create the file in `docs/design-docs/`.
2. Add an entry to this index with a one-line description.
3. Cross-link from `docs/index.md` if the document introduces a new top-level concern.
