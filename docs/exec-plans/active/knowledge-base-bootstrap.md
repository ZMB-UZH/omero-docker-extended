# Execution Plan: Knowledge Base Bootstrap

## Goal
Introduce an agent-legible knowledge map and enforceable docs structure checks.

## Steps
1. Add index-style top-level docs and architecture map.
2. Add docs taxonomy for design docs, plans, product specs, and references.
3. Add linting automation to enforce required docs and cross-links.
