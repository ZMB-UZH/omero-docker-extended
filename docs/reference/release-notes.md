# Release Notes

## Current Documentation Refresh

### Highlights

- Replaced ad hoc historical narratives with implementation-level documentation.
- Added plugin-specific operation guides for each OMERO.web plugin package.
- Added architecture, deployment, operations, troubleshooting, and endpoint references.

### Documentation Principles Applied

- public-safe language,
- no personal incident details,
- explicit operational guidance,
- consistent structure for future updates.

## Future Update Template
